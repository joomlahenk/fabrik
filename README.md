Work is in progress to get it al working.

Final version:
================

Working in J!4.1.x & PHP 8.1, does not work on <J!4.

All version hacks (release) removed, to be reimplemented for >J!4 and <J!5; we start with the latest J!4 version.

All unused functions removed (yes, there are some).

Possible to upgrade from J!3 to J!4. Don't install anything in the Joomla folders.

No sample application and several links removed from home dashboard.

Backend adapted for Atum template, frontend adapted for Cassiopeia template.

Only real working plugins and all of them in the standard package.

Default language is Enlish only, other language can be installed seperately.

Build and Install:
================

The build tool should be working now.
Temporary only a limited amount of working plugins are installed.
